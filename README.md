Game Development with Unity and C#

Unity Basics:
1. Hierarchy - contains everything in the current scene (ex. levels, gameobjects, etc.)
2. Project - contains everything in the game (sprites, sound effects, visual files, scripts, tiles, fonts, and much more!)
3. Inspector - the magic happens here meaning we mess with the game objects here to make them functional (scale, position, rotation, and more!)
4. Scene - changes to graphics in inspector show up here ; also used for game view

Game Object: Invisible container filled with game components such as scenes and elements which define its behavior, appearance, and other properties
Pre-frabricated Game Objects:
RigidBody2D
CircleCollider2D

C# Basics:
1. Variables - Integer, Float, String(s), Bool
2. Public vs Private Variables
3. If-Else Statements
4. References
5. What does Instantiate do?
